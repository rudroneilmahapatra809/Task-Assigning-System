# Task-Assigning-System

Problem: 
In a company it is difficult for an administrator to assign any task at once to the employees working under him/her. The administrator needs to assign each of them any task one by one.

Solution: 
Create an app in which the administrator can select the employee and assign a task. 
As the administrator will assign a task, it will be displayed as a list on the screen to the employees.
As any employee completes a task, he/she can press the button, I have completed the task, and then the administrator gets the notification for this.
